To perform the ETL, an ORM like SQLAlchemy or appropriate DB-API for the database in question may be of use. Supplychainpy works with Pandas, so performing the transformations using Pandas may be an idea. The `DataFrame` or file passed as an argument must be identical to the format above (future versions of supplychainpy will be more lenient and attempt to identify if a minimum requirement is satisfied).\n",
